## Introduction

During this lab, XYZ.

## Code execution

With parameters (`params`) in Quarto, code chunks can be conditionally executed to create a version of the lab exercises with and without answers. 

This is a code block.

```{r}
print("Hello world!")
```

With `params` we can suppress the visibility of code chunks. Changing the `answers: true` to `answers: false` hides a code block.

```{.r .content-visible when-meta="params.answers"}
1+1
```

Additional textual explanation can be provided in the answers too.

:::{.content-visible when-meta="params.answers"}
This text is hidden if `answers: false`.
